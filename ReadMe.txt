The rules of the game of Mahjong may be found by clicking the "Rules" button on the first page of the GUI.  
In case this does not work, they are pasted below:

The rules are as follows: There are 136 total tiles. There are three basic suits: Bamboo, Character and Circle; 
and two honor suits: Wind and Dragon. The basic suits are numbered 1 - 9 and the honor suits have North, South, East, West 
and Red, Green and White respectively.  There are four identical copies of each tile in the full set. 
The game is played with 2-4 players. Each player begins with 13 tiles.  At the beginning of their turn, they draw a 
tile either from the set or by taking the previous player's discard.  The goal is to have four melds and an 
eyes during your turn.  Melds may be formed with either three identical tiles or three consecutive tiles of the 
same suit.  The honor suits may not form consecutive melds. (I.E. 3 red dragons is a meld, but red dragon, green dragon, white dragon is not). 
Eyes are made up of two identical tiles.  At the end of a player's turn, if they do not have the tiles 
to win in their hand, they must discard a tile.  The game continues until a player has a winning hand.

A few instructions on using the GUI:

1. The start screen has three options: Start game, Rules and Tiles.  Clicking Rules will bring up the rule text found above.
The Tiles button will show a picture of all the different tiles in the game so you can familiarize yourself with them before
starting.  This picture shows the tile images only.  The ones in-game have been numbered for convenience.  The field to the 
right of the Start game button must be filled with a digit 2, 3, or 4 indicating the desired number of players.  Once this has 
been entered, click Start game to begin.

2. The game will immediately start with player one.  The tiles in their hand will be at the bottom.  In the center of the GUI
will be two buttons: press the right one to draw from the set(tile deck).  Press the left one to take the previous player's
discard.  Only one of these buttons may be pressed per turn.  On player one's first turn, only the draw button is clickable
because there are currently no discards. 

3. Once either the draw or the take discard button is clicked, the now 14 hand tiles below will light up.  Select one of the tiles
to discard, then press End Turn on the right to confirm your discard selection.  At this point, another page will pop up informing
you which player's turn it now is.  This message will cover the entire play screen so as to prevent players from seeing their
opponent's hand.  Once the next player is ready to begin their turn, they must click the x to close out the message window.  At 
this point, they will see their tiles and be able to play their turn.


This game is implemented as an application.
